1. Class and Objects with examples
    Class has data/attributes and functions/methods
        > Attributes gets called itself, methods are called manually
        > Speciality of the constructor - All the methods of the constructor class (init) gets called automatically as soon as the object is initiated

2. Why Python is called object-oriented programming?
    Everything in Python is an Object (data structure, data type etc)

3. Advantages of OOPS concepts-
    > You can create your own datatypes
    > Code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab
